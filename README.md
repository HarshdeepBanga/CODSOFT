# CODSOFT
Hello Eveyone
This repository showcase my work on projects that were assigned to me during my Internship under the domain 'Data Science' by CodSoft. I had a great experience during this internship. I worked on different projects whose description is given below:
TASK-1 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION :
In this project, the task was to predict the survival rate of titanic dataset. It involves machine leraning algorithms using which we are able to train some specific models and extract meaningful information out of it.
TASK-3 IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION : This was another project that was there for me to be done for the accomplishment of my Internship. It is a classic machine learning task in which we need to classify iris dataset into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. Visualizations are made based on different parameters.
TASK-4 SALES PREDICTION : This was another task in which prediction was made based on sales dataset. It involves data preprocessing, visualizations and exploratory data analysis.
In brief, my experience of the Internship at CodSoft was great and I learnt many new things and this Internhsip also enhanced my skills.
